## WELCOME JAX

I will use this website to benefit my goals.

### TRADING
Trading strategy is a word document designed to explain the narrative of trading. What actually needs to happen in order to enter a trade. [tradingstrategy.docs](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmEFh2CzDLeigYMV1URQ3-yQJSS2wg?e=fC42Qg).

Trading plan is an excel document that highlights the profit target of 22%, lot size and recommended number of positions are additional benefits that help meet trading targets. [strategy.excel](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmEFh2CzDLeigYVzQsz9NLBcS__sBQ?e=Uk1N9y).
