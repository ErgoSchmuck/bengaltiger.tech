## WELCOME JAX

If I am ever undecided on what I should be doing, I will read the contents of this page and become fully aligned to what my strategy is.

### TRADING
Trading strategy is a word document designed to explain the narrative of trading. What actually needs to happen in order to enter a trade, I should always be experimenting on TradingView, there is so much to learn so long as I have an inquisitive mindset. [tradingstrategy.docs](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmEFh2CzDLeigYMV1URQ3-yQJSS2wg?e=fC42Qg).

Trading plan is an excel document that highlights the profit target of 22%, the lot size and recommended number of positions are additional benefits that help meet trading targets. This excel document should also be worked on consistently, there are infinite improvements to be made. [strategy.excel](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmEFh2CzDLeigYVzQsz9NLBcS__sBQ?e=Uk1N9y).

When I say I want to work, this is where I should head first - I should perfect my line studies and constantly try new things. For TradingView profile see [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/u/ErgoSchmuck/).

This I should protect, because it will be a valuable asset for additional streams of income when the time comes. For MT5 trading account information see [MQL5](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/1583452?source=Site+Signals+My).

### GAME

### WORK
This website will serve as a medium to learning MERN stack. The PluralSight channel to follow is [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/3a202b58-7fbe-486a-acab-c5b538471a6e?s=1). I am undecided on what to build using this space, I own the domain for a year and I need to have a functional proof of concept for anything worth renewing.

### SHOP
An ideal outcome of this website would be to have an ecommerce available for items and services. I will also incorporate a chat service here so people can communicate directly with me.
